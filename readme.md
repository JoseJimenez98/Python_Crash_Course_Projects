## INTRODUCTION
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Python is a very powerful scripting language that many indutries can take advatage of. So learning Python has become a must in today's engineering world. This is my attempt to begin learning how to code in Python. Having previous experience in Java and C++, I feel that learning Python will not only help me in my professional future, but also will help me to become a better programmer. To start off, these projects will be based off of Eric Matthes' book Python Crash Course, were he goes from the basics up to creating whole projects. Finally, a note before the projects are discussed, eventhough I did write this code, none of the ideas presented in these coding projects are mine and this repository only serves as a testiment to my first steps into the coding world of Python.

## Project #1: Alien Invasion Game
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In beginning, we will start with the alien invasion game because I feel like that would be a good way to show everyone my progress while at the same time, having fun. In the case of our project, we will be creating a space invaders clone. That is, we will have our user's ship locked in a horizontal path, that can only go left or right, in the bottom of the screen. While aliens start to "rain" down from the top of the screen. As the aliens move down, the goal of the player is to shoot the aliens to destroy them while avoiding taking damage from the aliens. Once the player takes three hits (represented in the amount of ships that the screen will display) the game is over and the player loses.
